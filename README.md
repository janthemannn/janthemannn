<h3>currently working on</h3>

- figuring out why my code doesn't work
- mastering the art of trial and error
- committing to the Git, I guess


<h3>what fills my thoughts</h3>

- raccoons, rats, frogs, and all things critter-adjacent
- data and spreadsheets
- whether it's an appropriate time to give my opinion (then giving it anyway)


<h3>coming soon to a repository near you</h3>

- Google Apps Scripts that ChatGPT helped me fumble my way through
- ADHD-driven chaos in the form of me trying to teach myself like five programming languages at once
- more spreadsheets because apparently I donâ€™t know when to stop
